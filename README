CBigInt

Descrption:

CBigInt is a class providing big integer calculation without any length limitation, theoretically, in cpp

CBigInt is also MSVC compatible only ( VC2005 or higher ) because of safety memory manipulation enhancement runtime used.

But if you use the standard manipulation runtime instead, it might be portable with other compilers.

thanks for supporting :-)
